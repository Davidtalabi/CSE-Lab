// BackwardChain
//
// This class implements a backward chaining inference procedure.  The
// implementation is very skeletal, and the resulting reasoning process is
// not particularly efficient.  Knowledge is restricted to the form of
// definite clauses, grouped into a list of positive literals (facts) and
// a list of Horn clause implications (rules).  The inference procedure
// maintains a list of goals.  On each step, a proof is sought for the
// first goal in this list, starting by an attempt to unify the goal with
// any known fact in the knowledge base.  If this fails, the rules are
// examined in the order in which they appear in the knowledge base, searching
// for a consequent that unifies with the goal.  Upon successful unification,
// a proof is sought for the conjunction of the rule antecedents.  If this
// fails, further rules are considered.  Note that this is a strictly
// depth-first approach, so it is incomplete.  Note, also, that there is
// no backtracking with regard to matches to facts -- the first match is
// always taken and other potential matches are ignored.  This can make
// the algorithm incomplete in another way.  In short, the order in which
// facts and rules appear in the knowledge base can have a large influence
// on the behavior of this inference procedure.
//
// In order to use this inference engine, the knowledge base must be
// initialized by a call to "initKB".  Queries are then submitted using the
// "ask" method.  The "ask" function returns a binding list which includes
// bindings for intermediate variables.
